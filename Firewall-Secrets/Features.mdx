### **Integration with Popular Version Control Systems**

Firewall Secrets seamlessly integrates with:

- **GitHub**
- **Bitbucket**
- **GitLab**

Supporting multiple version control systems simultaneously, it's adaptable for both small startups and large enterprises. With just one access token (read and comment permissions), you can easily incorporate Firewall Secrets into your existing workflow.

### **Runtime Scanning via Webhooks**

Stay ahead with real-time scanning capabilities:

- **Pull Requests**: Automatically scan code changes as they are proposed.
- **Live Commits**: Monitor ongoing commits to catch vulnerabilities immediately.

This ensures your assets are always up-to-date and protected, preventing sensitive information from slipping into main branches.

### **False Positive Management and Business-Critical Releases**

We understand that false positives can hinder development:

- **One-Click Allowlisting**: Quickly manage and dismiss false positives to keep your workflow smooth.
- **Flexible Allowlisting Options**:
  - **Organizational Level**: Implement allowlists across your entire organization.
  - **Version Control System Level**: Apply allowlists within specific VCS platforms.

By simplifying false positive management, you can focus on delivering business-critical releases without unnecessary delays.
