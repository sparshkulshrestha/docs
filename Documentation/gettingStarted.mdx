Getting started with The Firewall is straightforward:

1. **Deployment:** You can deploy The Firewall using either Helm or Docker Compose. With just one step, you can set up the platform without any complicated configurations.
2. **Integration:** Connect The Firewall to your preferred version control systems using a single access token (with read and comment permissions). It supports GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab simultaneously.
3. **Utilize Features:** Begin leveraging powerful features like asset inventory management, custom alerts via Slack or Microsoft Teams, granular permissions with Auth + RBAC and SSO (e.g., Okta), an incident tracker for managing patches and prioritizing issues, and a real-time dashboard displaying live statistics.
